Social culture at office
------------------------

Our office has became in more than a simple office because it's proved that we spend 
2 out 3 parts of our time, letting our house as a simple happy weekend part and sleeping place.

For the developers it's important to have a great place to spend the time due to it's 
well-known that our work is crucial for the organisation and a great environment is a must.

This important point has been taken into account by the managers from companies such as Google, 
Facebook or even Microsoft (can you believe it?). Because it's proved that a company stress-free 
is more productive than others. A good example is the little crew guys from "37 signals", that is 
a great group which understood what I am talking about. This small group are in different cities 
working together, with no stress working only 4 or 5 days at week and the company revenue is 
really enviable !

On the other hand, Facebook installations are more oriented on the human resources (or better said 
the real people) which make the companies' magic possible. We as engineers love technology, the new 
brand gadget, the newest macbook air or even the best internet connection. If you really want a change 
in your company don't be greedy with your employees, provide them good laptops, great installations 
and even permissions to arrive and leave as many times they need and at the time they want. Really, 
if you make this possible your employees will be more than pleased and more productive, the only 
rule you need to point out is respecting the deadlines and the meetings in order to finalise the 
projects and trust trust trust!
 
In addition, allowing the regular meetings on fridays "just because you can" presenting a new tech 
topic which can be interesting for the area, facilities for international certifications and stop 
doing the formal clothes and you will have a great high-tech organization. Let them participate in 
the geek community by writing articles, participating on symposiums or international events.

Keep in practice this and I assure you that you will have a great group committed with their work and 
looking after the quality of their efforts. That is a real company and not the ones which only push 
the deadlines making a stress atmosphere, really do it !

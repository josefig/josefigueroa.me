:tags: misc

Hello people, as you know I had little issues with my domain (josefig.org),
combined with a lot of work, little left time to write. But now I've been 
having time to write some articles.

As a matter of fact, I will be writing some articles of what I found interesting,
something that I worked with and found good enough to publish it or even a crazy
geeky thing.

Maybe you have realized that this is a new blog system that I've been working on
in order to publish bettter and better articles. It is a little web 2.0 with 
a better organization.

Thank you very much for reading it, I will be writing in english, spanish and 
french. Gracias!
